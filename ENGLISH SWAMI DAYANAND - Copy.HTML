<U><UL> <LI> <FONT COLOR=PALEPINK>EARLY LIFE OF DAYANAND : </FONT></UL></U> <BR>

<FONT COLOR=PALERED>Dayananda Saraswati was born on the 10th day of waning moon in the month of Purnimanta Phalguna (12 February 1824)
 on the tithi to a Hindu Brahmin family in Tankara, Kathiawad region (now Morbi district of Gujarat).
 His original name was Mool Shankar Tiwari because he was born in Dhanu Rashi and Mul Nakshatra.
 His father was Karshanji Lalji Trivedi, and his mother was Yashodabai.
<br><BR>
When he was eight years old, his Yajnopavita Sanskara ceremony was performed, marking his entry into formal education. 
His father was a follower of Shiva and taught him the ways to impress Shiva. He was also taught the importance of keeping fasts.
 On the occasion of Shivratri, Dayananda sat awake the whole night in obedience to Shiva. During one of these fasts, he saw a
 mouse eating the offerings and running over the idol's body. After seeing this, he questioned that if Shiva could not defend himself 
against a mouse, then how could he be the saviour 
of the world.<BR><BR>

The deaths of his younger sister and his uncle from cholera led Dayananda to ponder the meaning of life and death. 
He began asking questions which worried his parents. He was engaged in his early teens, but he decided marriage
 was not for him and ran away from home in 1846.<br><BR>

Dayanand Saraswati spent nearly twenty-five years, from 1845 to 1869, as a wandering ascetic,
 searching for religious truth. He gave up material goods and lived a life of self-denial, devoting himself to spiritual 
pursuits in forests, retreats in the Himalayan Mountains, and pilgrimage sites in northern India. During these years
 he practised various forms of yoga and became a disciple of a religious teacher named Virajanand Dandeesha. 
Virajanand believed that Hinduism had strayed from its historical roots and that many of its practices had become impure.
 Dayananda Sarasvati promised Virajanand that he would devote his life to restoring the rightful place of the Vedas in the Hindu faith.

<FONT COLOR=PALEORANGE>Aum or Om is considered by the Arya Samaj to be the highest and most proper name of God.
<IMG SRC=C:\Users\User\Pictures\Screenshots\K.png HEIGHT=20% WIDTH=30% ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=4 >
He believed that Hinduism had been corrupted by divergence from the founding principles of the Vedas and that 
Hindus had been misled by the priesthood for the priests' self-aggrandizement. For this mission,
 he founded the Arya Samaj, enunciating the Ten Universal Principles as a code for Universalism, 
called Krinvanto Vishwaryam. With these principles, he intended the whole world to be an abode for Aryas (Nobles).<BR><BR>

His next step was to reform Hinduism with a new dedication to God. He travelled the country challenging 
religious scholars and priests to discussions, winning repeatedly through the strength of his arguments and knowledge 
of Sanskrit and Vedas. Hindu priests discouraged the laity from reading Vedic scriptures, and encouraged rituals,
 such as bathing in the Ganges River and feeding of priests on anniversaries, which Dayananda pronounced as superstitions 
or self-serving practices. By exhorting the nation to reject such superstitious notions, his aim was to educate the nation to return
 to the teachings of the Vedas, and to follow the Vedic way of life. He also exhorted Hindus to accept social reforms, including the 
importance of cows for national prosperity as well as the adoption of Hindi as the national language for national integration. 
Through his daily life and practice of yoga and asanas, teachings, preaching, sermons and writings, he inspired Hindus to aspire for 
Swarajya (self governance), nationalism, and spiritualism. He advocated the equal rights and respects to women and advocated
 for the education of all children, regardless of gender.<BR><BR>

Dayanand also made critical analyses of faiths including Christianity & Islam, as well as of other Indian faiths like 
Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. In addition to discouraging idolatry in Hinduism, he was also against
 what he considered to be the corruption of the true and pure faith in his own country. Unlike many other reform 
movements of his times within Hinduism, the Arya Samaj's appeal was addressed not only to the educated few in India,
 but to the world as a whole as evidenced in the sixth principle of the Arya Samaj. As a result, his teachings professed 
universalism for all the living beings and not for any particular sect, faith, community or nation.<BR><BR>

Arya Samaj allows and encourages converts to Hinduism. Dayananda's concept of dharma is stated in the 
"Beliefs and Disbeliefs" section of Satyartha Prakash, he says:</FONT><BR>
<IMG SRC=C:\Users\User\Pictures\Screenshots\M.png HEIGHT=10% WIDTH=30% ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=4>
<FONT COLOR=RED>"I accept as Dharma whatever is in full conformity with impartial justice, truthfulness and the like; that which is not opposed to the teachings of God as embodied in the Vedas. Whatever is not free from partiality and is unjust, partaking of untruth and the like, and opposed to the teachings of God as embodied in the Vedas—that I hold as adharma."
"He, who after careful thinking, is ever ready to accept truth and reject falsehood; who counts the happiness of others as he does that of his own self, him I call just."
</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>— Satyarth Prakash</CENTER></FONT><BR><bR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=PALEORANGE>Dayananda's Vedic message emphasized respect and reverence for other human beings, 
supported by the Vedic notion of the divine nature of the individual. In the ten principles of the 
Arya Samaj, he enshrined the idea that "All actions should be performed with the prime objective
 of benefiting mankind", as opposed to following dogmatic rituals or revering idols and symbols. 
The first five principles speak of Truth, while the last five speak of a society with nobility, civics, 
co-living, and disciplined life. In his own life, he interpreted moksha to be a lower calling, as it argued 
for benefits to the individual, rather than calling to emancipate others.<BR><BR>

Dayananda's "back to the Vedas" message influenced many thinkers and philosophers the world over</FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR=VIOLET>Dayananda formed ARYA SAMAJ on7th april  1875 at bombay;Saraswati's creation, the Arya Samaj, condemned practices of several different religions
 and communities, including such practices as idol worship, animal sacrifice, pilgrimages, priest craft, 
offerings made in temples, the castes, child marriages, meat eating and discrimination against women.
 He argued that all of these practices ran contrary to good sense and the wisdom of the Vedas.</font><BR>

4.We should be ever ready to imbibe truth and forsake untruth.<BR>
5.All acts should be done in accordance with Dharma, i.e. after deliberating upon what is truth and untruth.<BR>
6. The prime object of Arya Samaj is to do good to the whole world, i.e. to achieve physical, spiritual and social prosperity for all.<BR>

7. Our conduct towards all should be guided by love, by injunctions of Dharma and according to their respective positions.<BR>
8. One should dispel ignorance and promote knowledge.<BR>
9. One should not be content with one’s own prosperity only, but should consider the prosperity of all as his own prosperity.<BR>

He severely criticized practices which he considered to be superstitions, including sorcery, and astrology, which were prevalent in 
India at the time. Below are several quotes from his book, Sathyarth Prakash:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR=RED>"They should also counsel then against all things that lead to superstition, and are opposed to true religion and science, so that they may never give credence to such imaginary things as ghosts (Bhuts) and spirits (Preta)."
</FONT><BR>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>— Satyarth Prakash</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=RED>"All alchemists, magicians, sorcerers, wizards, spiritists, etc. are cheats and all their practices should be looked upon as nothing but downright fraud. Young people should be well counseled against all these frauds, in their very childhood, so that they may not suffer through being duped by any unprincipled person."
